# Face Emotion Detector

This project is a real-time face emotion detection system that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and OpenCV. The system captures live video from a webcam, detects faces in the frame, and predicts the emotion displayed by each detected face.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-emotion-detector.git
   cd face-emotion-detector
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset Preparation

1. **Download the dataset:**
   - Go to Kaggle and download the face emotion dataset.
   - [Face Emotion Recognition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013)

2. **Organize your dataset:**
   - Extract the dataset and organize it into the following directory structure:
     ```
     images/
     ├── train/
     │   ├── angry/
     │   ├── disgust/
     │   ├── fear/
     │   ├── happy/
     │   ├── neutral/
     │   ├── sad/
     │   └── surprise/
     └── validation/
         ├── angry/
         ├── disgust/
         ├── fear/
         ├── happy/
         ├── neutral/
         ├── sad/
         └── surprise/
     ```

## Usage

### Model Training

1. **Prepare your dataset:**
   - Ensure your dataset is organized as described in the [Dataset Preparation](#dataset-preparation) section.

2. **Run the training script:**
   - The provided script trains a CNN model on the prepared dataset.
   - The trained model is saved as `emotiondetector2.h5` and its architecture as `emotiondetector2.json`.

### Real-Time Emotion Detection

1. **Ensure you have a webcam connected to your system.**

2. **Run the real-time detection script:**
   - The script will start the webcam, detect faces in the video stream, and predict the emotion of each detected face.
   - Detected faces will be highlighted with a bounding box and the predicted emotion will be displayed above the box.

3. **Terminate the script:**
   - Press `q` to exit the real-time detection loop and close the application.

## Example Commands

### Training the Model

To train the model, make sure your dataset is organized as described above and then run:

```sh
python train_model.py
```

### Running Real-Time Detection

To start the real-time emotion detection, run:

```sh
python real_time_detection.py
```
